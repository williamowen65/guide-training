 <h2>Covid Precautions</h2>

<p>To help slow the spread of covid, have a mask handy for close interactions and when not needed, just keep it somewhere easy to access.</p>

  <p>The times to be aware of:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Transporting guests in the vans</li>
      <li>Unloading/Setting up on the Beach/Instruction</li>
      <li>Rafting up if there are whales</li>
      <li>Maybe even performing a rescue</li>
      <li>Maybe double boats where the paddlers are from different parties??</li>
      <li> Or, if you are in a double with guests ( We don't send guests out in singles )</li>
  </ul>
