        <h1>Welcome to the company!</h1>
        <p>
            Congratulations on getting this
            awesome job. You'll get paid for
            enjoying the outdoors with your guests
            and gain confidence as guide. On top
            of that, kayaking is a reward in and
            of itself. To ensure a fun season of
            guiding, safety is a top priority.
        </p>
        <!-- Brief description of what this is for -->
        <p>
            My job is to layout a plan for kayak
            guide training. I'm also going to
            provide resources to help you succeed.
            Hopefully this guide will better
            prepare you for what we will be
            practicing in terms of kayak guide
            safety. Except to get in the water to
            practice these routines.
        </p>

            In here you'll find links to short
            videos of rescues being performed.
            Simple as they look in staged videos,
            it is important to practice them
            yourself in staged scenarios before
            you, or someone else, is in a
            situation that relies on those skills.
            These video are a heads up for what
            <span class="underline"
                >returning and new guides</span
            >
            are expected to practice early in the
            season, and occasionally throughout
            the summer, all during paid trainings.

            The content we covered in training
            touches on the various kayak forms of
            rescues, to effectively using your
            radio for communication and for
            weather, to understanding currents in
            the context of tides, and kayak
            rolling lessons will be also be
            provided to increase your confidence
            and saftey - a skill that is very
            useful, even helps build up skills
            that prevent capsizes in the first
            place.

            <em>On a side note,</em> while the
            casual tone of the videos make it look
            easy (and with practice, they are
            easy) these videos won't do justice to
            preparing you for every situation, but
            they are a place to start. It's
            helpful is to learn from other
            kayakers mistakes, put yourself in
            their shoes and think about what they
            could have done differently. These
            stories will give you perspective to
            able to make good decisions and are
            important for mental preparedness.
            Resources for this will be pulled from
            the book Sea Kayaker's Deep Trouble by
            George Gronseth. We'll revisit this
            topic together in-person around a
            campfire, or at a company meetings.
            But feel free to get a copy of the
            book if interested, but we will have a
            copy of the first and second book at
            our headquarters.

            For now, take a look at what's here as
            it will serve as a resource during the
            season.
